Problem Description: 
A 64-bit integer can be viewed as an array of 64 bits, with the bit at index 0 correÂ¬
sponding to the least significant bit (LSB), and the bit at index 63 corresponding to
the most significant bit (MSB). Implement code that takes as input a 64-bit integer
and swaps the bits at indices i and j.
